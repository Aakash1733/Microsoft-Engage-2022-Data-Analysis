                      <p>
                        Determining the optimal fuel type for your model as a manufacturer can have a significant impact on the model's success. Diesel, petrol, CNG+Petrol, and hybrid are the main fuel types now available on the market. We've analysed the number of cars produced by various Manufacturers that use various fuel kinds.
A manufacturer can readily identify the prevailing order of Manufacturers in the market based on the proportion of units manufactured by using the plot. A manufacturer can also forecast the current trend in car fuel type preferences.
The graph shows that the share of CNG + Petrol and Hybrid variations is still quite low when compared to petrol and diesel variants, indicating that there is room for new launches and success.

                      <p>
                        A car's mileage and power are two crucial specifications. As a manufacturer, you must determine the best possible mix of power and mileage for the price.
                        We've examined mileage and power variations for several makes at varying costs.
                        We notice that most car manufacturers place a premium on price and mileage over power. As a result, we can conclude that automakers prefer automobiles that are more inexpensive and have better fuel efficiency than those that are more powerful.
                        Following that, we notice that keeping power as our primary parameter price grows with power. We can assert, in instance, that powerful cars are maintained pricey by manufacturers. 
                        When we look at the relationship between power and mileage attentively, we can see that they are inversely proportional. As a result, we can conclude that powerful automobiles are inefficient in terms of fuel use.
                        This graphic is useful from the standpoint of a new manufacturer in that it allows him to forecast predicted values for any of the three parameters for given rest values.
                        We can also see that the Good power-Good mileage Couple has a lot of potential. </p>

                      <p>
                        Your goal as a manufacturer is to provide your consumers with the best feasible power output within specific constraints. The price and body type were used as given criteria, and the data was then categorised according to the power output. According to our data, we used a pricing range of up to 800000 on the Y axis and a power output range of up to 800 on the x axis. We utilised varied colours to symbolise different body types.
From the manufacturer's perspective, the aforementioned representation has numerous helpful results. When we compare price to power, we can see that powerful cars are generally more expensive. Customers also prefer pricing checks to power checks, and we find a space for new models here. Powerful cars in the SUV sector(most popular) in an affordable range is required. 
Following that, we may deduce that the most popular car model is the SUV, with one of the reasons for its popularity being its affordability.
We can deduce from a comparison of body type and power that all demanded body types fall within the power range of 50-250.
The facts about the preferred pricing range, which is up to 300000, and preferred power range, which is about 50-250, may be found in this graph. SUVs are the most popular body type.

                      Your main priority as a manufacturer is to determine the optimal model for your vehicle. We grouped the available data into homogeneous clusters based on their models, then rendered the data diagrammatically to meet the demands of various models. Here models involved are – Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MPV, Coupe, Convertible and Sports. Because percentage numbers are involved, adopting a Pie chart for presentation adds an extra benefit of greater visual comparison. Simply by looking at the graph, a manufacturer can learn a lot more about market trends.
This representation not only provides information about the many models available on the market, but it also illustrates the winning and losing models.
Manufacturers may now assess market demand, as well as the most popular and least popular models. This is advantageous in that a manufacturer can compare the least and most popular models to generate a list of specs for their vehicle. They can also investigate the reasons for the drop in demand, make the necessary improvements, and provide a new platform for the launch's success.

                      <h2>Detailed Analysis</h2>
                      <p>
                        Taxation in India has key role in defining the affordability of the vehicle to the customer .
Manufacturers need to pay keen attention of the attributes that define the tax criteria . An intelligently build vehicle can change the shape of the market by acquiring less tax and more features . The graph helps to identify the tax groups and the number of  models of vehicle available under each tax group .
This is clear from the representation that the value of number of cars is high on the left side of each plot . Hence , it is notable that the current players are trying to fill their vehicles to the brim with the technology that falls under a particular tax segment .
                        <br><br>
                        The GST on automobiles is kept inside the 28 percent band, and the Indian government has also announced a list of cess to be paid on various types of automobiles. Cess has been imposed on several types of vehicles, ranging from 1% to 15%.
We stratified the data count based on the displacement presented in the previous plots, and then replotted three unique graphs based on the GST charge parameters.
We may deduce from the count plot of the entire dataset that the manufacturers are more interested in counts in the 1000-2000cc range.
According to government regulations, cars with displacement less than 1200 cc must pay 18 percent GST plus an additional 1% cess, which is reflected in the vehicle under 19 percent plot. We may deduce from the graph that manufacturers make the best use of the criterion by providing the client with the best possible displacement specs at a constant Tax rate.
Similarly, government regulations mandate that cars with displacements ranging from 1200- 1500 cc be subject to a combined GST and additional cess rate of between 21 and 45 percent. Another factor determining this is the length of the car; cars with a length less than 4000mm have a GST rate of 18% + 3% cess, whereas cars with a length larger than 4000mm have a GST rate of 28 % + 17 % cess. The key to note here is the same as in the previous plot: manufacturers tend to provide the best output in terms of displacement to their customers for particular tax rates.
The relationship between displacement and power of an automobile is used to analyse the last plot, i.e. vehicles under 48 percent. The higher the displacement, the more powerful the car. However, because very powerful cars are not required in the Indian market, manufacturers prefer to cluster their launches around the lower bound, with a consistent tax rate of 48 percent for cars with a displacement range more than 1500cc.

                      <p>
                        We've depicted the distribution of fuel types for various body kinds in this graph, as well as the fuel tank capacity options in order of maximum to minimum count for each. Three separate concentric circles are used to illustrate each of these three standards.
The distribution of body types in the market trend is depicted by the first concentric circle. The most popular body style in this category is the SUV. Next on the list are the Hatchback and Sedan, which are in close competition with each other.
The distribution of fuel kinds for various body types is represented by the second concentric circle. We can see that SUV makers are more inclined to Diesel vehicles, whereas Hatchback producers are more inclined to Petrol ones. Sedan makers, on the other hand, place equal emphasis on both of these. Another point to note is that the share of hybrid and CNG + Petrol cars is quite small, implying that new car makers have room to grow in this market.
The fuel tank capacity for each of the unique combinations of numerous fuel kinds and car body types is displayed in the last circle. We may deduce that the optimal range for petrol variants is 30-50 litres, whereas the preferred range for diesel variants is 40-70 litres.

                      <p>
                        A car's torque is exactly proportionate to its power. The more the torque, the more power the car will produce. In addition, the graph shows that mileage and torque are inversely proportional to one another. As a result, we can deduce that mileage and power are inversely proportional, i.e., the higher the power, the lower the mileage of the car, and vice versa.
We have developed a relationship between the car's mileage, torque relationship, and fuel type reliance in this plot.
We may deduce that when we go closer to high torque, we see that just a few data points are available, and that the majority of them are blue, indicating that the majority of automobiles with high torque are petrol variants, or, to put it another way, powerful cars are run on petrol.
In addition, we can see that in the Indian market, manufacturers are more focused on increasing mileage than increasing power. One reason for this could be India's terrain, which does not necessitate particularly powerful cars, thus lowering the threshold there to boost another attribute could be a strategy.
We can also see that hybrid and CNG + Petrol models have a relatively low fraction of the market, and that almost all of them give good mileage over power.

                        In a car, a transmission system, often known as a gearbox, is the mechanical system of gears and gear trains that conveys power generated by the engine to the wheels. A transmission is a device that allows a person to transmit power to a vehicle in a controlled manner; without it, the vehicle would not be able to drive efficiently. Manual transmission, automatic transmission, continuously variable transmission, automatic manual transmission, and dual clutch transmission are all examples of car transmissions.
                        We've plotted numerous Manufacturers versus various types of car transmissions in this graph.
                        For the Indian market trend, we may deduce that manufacturers choose to launch more and more manual transmission cars, followed by automatic transmission cars.
                        It's also worth noting that the proportion of rest transmission is quite small. Maruti Suzuki is the manufacturer's market leader in both the petrol and diesel variants.

                      <p>
                        India has the dubious distinction of having nine of the world's top ten most polluted cities. Greater Noida, Noida, Lucknow, and Delhi are among the nine cities in north India. While numerous things contribute to northern India's filthy air, skies, and human lungs, automobile pollution plays a significant role.
                        As a result, it's predictable that the Indian government is gradually but steadily supporting the use of electric vehicles. And, in terms of our ability to commute, we may have come full circle. While electric vehicles (EVs) lost out against gasoline-powered vehicles in the 1900s, this may no longer be the case.
                        An EV is a vehicle that runs on electricity rather than gasoline and has a battery instead of a gas tank.
                        EVs have reduced operating costs and are also environmentally benign because they have fewer moving parts.
                        In India, the cost of an electric vehicle's fuel is around 80 paisa per kilometre. Compare this to the cost of petrol in Indian cities, which is now over Rs 100 per litre, or Rs 7-8 per kilometre to operate a petrol-powered vehicle.
                        The private sector has recognised that the EV's domination is unavoidable.
                        EVs are being used for deliveries by companies such as Amazon, Swiggy, Zomato, and Ikea.
                        Automobile manufacturers like as Mahindra are cooperating with consumers such as Ola, while Tata Motors is partnering with Blu Smart Mobility to assure more electric vehicle delivery and ride-hailing services.

                        This yearly sales report covers the financial year 2019 and shows that about a third of the country's passenger car market is projected to be disrupted. Lockdown rules varied by state, having varying degrees of influence on distribution, retail, and after-sales operations, resulting in lower car and component manufacturing. Due to the stringent restrictions imposed by the state government, showroom closures resulted in not only no sales but also a rise in fixed expenditures over time.

                        The annual car sales report for each state is shown above. We can see that roughly 1.74 million cars were sold in the first half of the financial year 2019, while 1.63 million were sold in the second half. With approximately 1 million sales, the West zone, which includes the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Goa, is the leading zone. Maharashtra is in charge of the zone.
                        The North Zone, which includes Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh, and Chandigarh, is next on the list, with 980k units sold. The state of Uttar Pradesh is the zone's leader.
                        The South Zone, which includes Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Pondicherry, comes in second with sales of around 940 thousand units. Kerela leading the zone.
                        The East zone, which comprises West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Mizoram, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, has the least amount of sales. West Bengal led the zone with a zonal sale of around 420k.

                      <p>
                        Credit Availability provides power to purchase . This line seems to be true for the First Customer and customers coming from 
                        middle and lower income class (as can be inferred by the type of car purchased).The customers with low-income tend to be a car owner 
                        with credits . Customers tend to buy a mid range car from their own money and hence results are tilting towards no-credit buy in the 
                        13-20 lakhs range. But , this fact must not be neglected that the availability of credit may not surpass self buy, it still doubles the 
                        sale of vehicle . As customers dependent on credit wont come in the class of potential buyers if credits are over .
                        <br>
                        Manufactures must strenthen their Business with banks to maintain this customer base and try to increase the same.

                      <p>
                        As a manufacturer, one of the most difficult decisions you'll have to make is whether to use petrol or diesel in your vehicle. Diesel automobiles, on the one hand, have a low fuel cost and great fuel economy, yet petrol cars have a higher RPM and beginning acceleration, making them more powerful.
                        For a handful of the major brands, we've shown a comparison of the number of sold quantities of petrol and diesel variants.
                        Maruti Suzuki is the market leader in both types, with approximately 126 thousand petrol variants and 137 thousand diesel variants sold.
                        Also, we can see that, with a 6:4 ratio, petrol variants continue to outnumber diesel variants in total.<br>
